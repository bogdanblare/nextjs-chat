## Setup Finished Project


Go to [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) and create a account and project.

Find the Private Key `c2f82e63-9978-4c5c-9c17-8b0dec845dc6` and Project ID `b60a6d8b-d377-477e-af88-e47de35b3e89` then replace the values with your API keys.

The project has been deleted so those keys won't work anymore.
